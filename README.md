# squarepush

## Project Overview

squarepush is a game where the user can move a ninja charecter around a grid, pushing any colored blocks that may be near it. When a 2x2 group of a single color is present next to the ninja, the group becomes removable. The object of the game is to remove all the color from the grid.

## Playing the Game

This is what the app looks like upon launch; the 5x5 is the default configuration, so that is the one that is automatically displayed. The ninja can not leave the board, so only the up and left buttons are active.

In order to run this app, create a react app and replace the src with the one provided here. It is also neccessary to import the svg file in the repository public folder into the app's public folder. The app should then be useable via the npm start command.
